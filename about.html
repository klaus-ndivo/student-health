            <p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">
                My project has to do with how health affects school performance. It is a very serious and common issue that more and more people are becoming aware of. Many students are contending with increased stress, burnout, and other health issues. These problems can have a significant impact on their academic performance.

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-500 mb-4">Purpose</h2>
            <p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">
                My project aims to research the impact of both mental and physical health on the academic performance of students. There is already plenty of existing research. I plan to send out surveys, conduct interviews, and create real-life case studies. This approach helps me gain broader perspective and provide deeper understanding of the issue.

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-500 mb-4">Research Question</h2>
            <p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">
                My primary research question is: What is the effect of mental and physical health on student academic performance? To find out, I’m reviewing research from both psychology and education. I’m learning how academic performance is influenced by stress, anxiety, sleep habits, and physical exercise. I’ll also explore how these factors affect students across different backgrounds, majors, and class years.

            <p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">
                I plan to present research and student stories together on this website to provide useful information about how health and learning are connected. I will translate this information into clear writing, visuals, and charts. A major goal is to create a site that’s engaging and easy to navigate while improving my skills in presenting concepts to different audiences.

                This project is designed for students, teachers, advisors, and school leaders. While many already advocate for student health, they may not fully understand its impact on academic performance. Through this site, I hope to deliver valuable insights using accessible language and practical tools.
